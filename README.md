## Description

Exploratory and Predictive analysis of the dataset  
 - Defined heroes with highest pick and wining rates
 - Identified some heroes combinations with the highest winning probability
 - Built ML models for predicting a winning team and game mode

## Overview

Dota 2 is a popular computer game with two teams of 5 players. At the start of the game each player chooses a unique hero with different strengths and weaknesses. The dataset is reasonably sparse as only 10 of 113 possible heroes are chosen in a given game. All games were played in a space of 2 hours on the 13th of August, 2016

---

## Dataset info

Each row of the dataset is a single game with the following features (in the order in the vector):
1. Team won the game (1 or -1)
2. Cluster ID (related to location)
3. Game mode (eg All Pick)
4. Game type (eg. Ranked)
5. *till end*: Each element is an indicator for a hero.   
    Value of 1 indicates that a player from team '1' played as that hero and '-1' for the other team.    
    Hero can be selected by only one player each game. This means that each row has five '1' and five '-1' values.

## Software implementation

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in the `dota2.ipynb`.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is provided in `dataset` folder 
and was taken from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dota2+Games+Results).
